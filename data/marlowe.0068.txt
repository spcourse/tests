     FAUSTUS. The Pope will curse them for their sloth to-day,
     That slept both Bruno and his crown away.
     But now, that Faustus may delight his mind,
     And by their folly make some merriment,
     Sweet Mephistophilis, so charm me here,
     That I may walk invisible to all,
     And do whate'er I please, unseen of any.
