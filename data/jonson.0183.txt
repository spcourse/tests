LEATH. Well, luck and Saint Bartholomew! out with the sign of our
invention, in the name of wit, and do you beat the drum the while: all
the foul i' the Fair, I mean all the dirt in Smithfield,--that's one
of master Littlewit's carwhitchets now--will be thrown at our banner
to-day, if the matter does not please the people. O the motions that I
Lanthorn Leatherhead have given light to, in my time, since my master
Pod died! Jerusalem was a stately thing, and so was Nineveh, and the
city of Norwich, and Sodom and Gomorrah, with the rising of the
prentices, and pulling down the bawdy-houses there upon
Shrove-Tuesday; but the Gun-powder plot, there was a get-penny! I have
presented that to an eighteen or twenty pence audience, nine times in
an afternoon. Your home-born projects prove ever the best, they are so
easy and familiar; they put too much learning in their things now o'
days: and that I fear will be the spoil of this. Littlewit! I say,
Micklewit! if not too mickle! look to your gathering there, goodman
Filcher.
